## WHY MECHANICAL ENGINEERING?🛠🪓⚙
![Image](https://blogs.staffs.ac.uk/student-blogs/files/2017/07/IMG_3825-678x367.jpg).
* If you’re interested in the design, development, installation, operation or maintenance of just about anything that has moveable parts just like me,then mechanical engineering could be the programme of study for you.

Mechanical Engineering is perhaps the most diverse and versatile of the engineering disciplines. In addition to physics and mathematics, it encompasses key elements of aerospace, electrical, civil, chemical and even materials science and bio-engineering. Mechanical engineering touches virtually every aspect of modern life, from mobile phones and biomedical devices, to aircrafts and power plants. Not only engineering, mechanical engineers deal with economic issues, from the cost of a single component, to the economic impact of a manufacturing plant. Besides this, mechanical engineers can also be found in sales, engineering management, and corporate management. Versatility is another unique advantage in a world that is undergoing constant economic, political, industrial, and social change. Mechanical engineers are educated and positioned, not only to adapt, but to define and direct change.

## Is Programming Hard ?🖥⌨🖱☢
According to me ,computer programming languages are not easy to master, but that doesn’t mean they are impossible to learn, either. In a lot of ways, coding is like cooking—both require you to follow a set of instructions with no room for error. It also helps if you understand that the most common state for a programmer, especially a new programmer, is a sense of ineptitude. There is almost a limitless amount of stuff to learn, so programmers constantly need to learn new tools, languages and technologies.

 Learning a computer programming language is like learning anything else—it will be easier for some people, and more difficult for others. Whether or not programming is hard for you depends as much on your personality as your computer skills. According to Brian Feldman, robotics specialist and founder of Feldman Consulting Enterprises, there are some key personality traits programmers need to be successful, including:

1. Nearly unlimited persistence to continue trying to troubleshoot, fix and develop
 
 2.Excellent short- and long-term memory
 
 3.Understanding of how things interrelate
 
 4.Excellent attention to detail
 
 If you don’t have these personality traits, you can still learn how to code but your experience of learning a new programming language may be more difficult than it is for someone who has the personality traits of a programmer.
